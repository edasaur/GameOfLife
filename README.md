GameOfLife
====

This will be a project to simulate the classic Conway's Game of Life using javascript, so that it will be an in-browser game.



Currently, the js library being used is jquery, but in favor of exploring another flavor of js, I will be changing this over to angularjs shortly after the first version of this application is built.
